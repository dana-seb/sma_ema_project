# sma_ema_project

My project is an algorithmic trading program.  It is based on an SMA - EMA trading strategy.  Currently there is a SMAEMA class with several functions that can get data from an external source. The functions that are included in my program give a comparison of the SMA - EMA strategy to a simple buy and hold strategy and a chart to visualize the two strategies over time.
